Task:-

Iris Flower has three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here the task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from measurements of the iris species and classify them.

1) The column Species is the target variable
2) The column Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm are feature variables
3) Since it is predicting output in category, hence categorical classifier SVM(Support vector machine) is used.
4) Accuracy of model is checked, classification report is made and model evaluation using confusion matrix.
